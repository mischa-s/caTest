      content: 'In Sofia we stayed at the Ken (community hub) of Hashomer Hatzair, a secular Socialist-Zionist Jewish youth movement. For many of us who were walking, what we understood to be the definition of Zionism differed radically from what it meant to this organization. Staying with them for a few days, we had a chance to explore a little bit about what “the right to self-determination for all peoples,” means. For these youth, Zionism does not equate with an aggressive stance towards Palestine. Rather, they hold the ability for Palestinians to be able to thrive as a culture in independence and interdependence as fundamental to any realization of Zionism.'

The day after we arrived, we met with Bulgarian and Dutch social democratic organizations, discussing what it meant for the population of a country, in particular the youth of a country, to take an active role in shaping their country. The second community was a Syrian refugee camp. Bulgaria is separated from Syria by only one country, Turkey, and after months of walking we realized just how close to this conflict we had come.'

      content: 'In addition to Node activities in Sofia, our major preoccupation was preparing for the mountains. Our time in Serbia had demonstrated that while we could manage the journey in the cold, we would need more gear if we wanted to be serious about studying. We checked out all the outdoor gear shops and second hand stores. We bought Ice Breaker clothing, wool sweaters, fleece blankets, and new shoes. We also made some decisions within the group, for example to create “evening Jedis” who would organize the evenings and, most importantly, host biography work.'

      content: 'As had become our routine, preparing to leave Sofia meant saying “Goodbye!” and “Welcome!” practically in the same breath.  Generally this involved a simple heartfelt expression of gratitude by all parties involved, but in this case a slightly stranger ceremony was enacted. Singing slowly in the candlelight, we spontaneously lifted Michael, who was departing, over our heads and held him there. A new student, Gregor, who knew none of us, had just arrived from the bus station half an hour before and surely wondered what he had walked into. '

With the exception of River all of us would walk to Athens. Eleven people. One puppy. Mountain bound. And so we pressed on.'

      content: 'Camping in the woods above Sapareva Banya, our first night back out on the trail, a couple out for a walk approached us through the pines as we made a fire. We expected to be reprimanded for making a fire, but they seemed nice and kept motioning up the road. As they were speaking to us in Bulgarian, we didn’t know what they were saying. They made a phone call and passed the phone to us. Their friend who spoke English told us that they had seen a black bear further up the road on the previous day and warned us to be careful. We decided to hang our food high up in the trees and put our tents far away from ‘the kitchen’ again. This time Kai, Mischa, and River just used some rope over a branch to pull the food up into the air, and, when they sat down exhausted from the hauling, it again looked to pose hardly more than a nuisance for a determined bear.'

      content: ' The next day, as we penetrated deeper into the mountains, we passed an outdoor education station, and when we asked the ranger there about bears, he laughed. “They never come near the trails,” he said, “and besides, it is only brown bears here.” Making our way up through the snow, we arrived at our destination, Skakavitza hut. The only way we were going to make it through the mountains was by staying in the huts at night. The first night, River tried to brave the outdoors, but came inside in the middle of night insisting that he would have been warm enough if he hadn’t had to stick his nose out of his sleeping bag to breathe.'

      content: 'While there, we encountered a dilemma: the owner of the hut warned us that we had walked into the first snow of the year and it was too dangerous to cross the mountains. However, Vilja and Madalena had gone a different way and texted us the next day from where the owner had said it was impossible to reach. They said it was not only safe, but extraordinarily beautiful. Cell service was choppy and communication hard, so we decided to spend a day at the hut to mull over the question of what to do and began a Focus Week for that time on Rudolf Steiner’s Philosophy of Freedom. When we awoke the following morning the snow had melted and that evening, Vilja and Madalena surprised us by coming back and showing up at our hut. The next morning they escorted us up to the seven lakes.'

This journey is maybe more about me. About my life. About what life for me, in its essence, is about. And to come back to this question, I know that it is about connection for me.

The serenity of the place had a deep impact on us. We chose to stay a day at Ivan Vasov to have the chance to study in the majesty that lay all around, and then Anna injured her ankle and we decided to stay another day. Because of the biography work at night and the Focus Week on the Philosophy of Freedom, we were loath to split the group during this time, but if one injury meant the rest couldn’t cross the mountains, would we stick together?'

Two students needed to rest and recover from illness and injuries. The rest pressed on, agreeing that we would meet in two nights’ time. But when we started walking some of us doubted the choice to leave them to hitchhike, so we turned back. Tension was thick. Some wanted to go on. For others, the most important fact of our classroom was that we were doing it together. Okay, pause. We spent the entire afternoon collectively discussing what needed discussing. We had an evening to play cards and decompress from the confrontation before the next day of sitting around the fire for twelve hours: discussing, listening, sharing, discovering. What is this actually? What are we doing? Is there a hierarchy of importance between being together, studying, and walking?'

Being together and walking four hours a day, six days a week, were next, insofar as they helped the studies. The roles were divided: route, food, studies stewards, evening host, online communication, time keeper, finances, Node-organizer. Each person who took up responsibility was to balance their decisions between what they heard from the group and what they perceived would best fulfill the objectives.'

We arrived in Bansko, a village located in the valley between the Pirin and Rila mountain ranges, which has turned from a sleepy backwoods town into a full blown ski resort. It was shocking to experience the exuberant hotels layered so thickly upon the hillside, amidst the old settlements that are cautiously turning over a new leaf in the post-communist era. From here our trail led up past people training for biathlon and up a ski hill to Vihren hut, frequented by many tourists and with the added bonus of hot showers.'

Mounting the ridge the next morning turned into a lengthy scramble as we exited the tourist zone and found ourselves on a rugged path that led up through jagged boulders and onto a steep hillside that sent little avalanches down in response to every misplaced foot. Never mind - what a view!'

      content: 'Making our way along the ridge, we weren’t sure if we would make it to camp before dark. As the day wore on some of us reached our physical limits and felt we simply could not continue. Starring out at the valleys below in utter exhaustion, it was tempting to just make camp right where we were. We held a short meeting to discuss our options. There was almost no breeze but being high and exposed like that we knew that if we made camp there and a wind came up overnight, it could toss us down a canyon in the blink of an eye, so we had no choice but to press on. Finally, after many hours of climbing, our trail led down off the ridge to the edge of a mountain lake. The closest hut was still an hour away so we scrambled down a rocky slope to the banks of the lake and made camp in the last rays of sunlight. We nestled behind a hill for a frigid and dark dinner, but luckily the temperature had come up a bit over our time in the mountains and we awoke refreshed. The short climb to Tevno Ezero hut was accomplished without too much difficulty in the morning light and we spent the day there making up for the lost study time of the previous day.'

      content: 'Just like that we were almost through the mountains. From Tevno Ezero we had one last climb to make and shortly our trail led no longer up but down, through a rocky crevice and out onto beautiful pasture land back below the tree line. It was difficult to leave the freedom of the majestic mountains behind, but being back in forests again we felt we had cheated the seasons, descending from doubtless winter into autumnal air, the smell of the falling leaves filling our nostrils to the brim. We spent the night in Pirin Hut exchanging songs with the local Ranger, Sheriff, Fireman, and Winemaker. After sharing most of the songs we’d been singing while walking, we sat around joking and making small talk with them, and playing cards, while they ate and drank seemingly endless quantities, deep into the night. In the morning we made for Melnik, and as we wove down out of the hills, the thick morning mist slowly disappeared and our first sight of Greece appeared far away between two mountains. By lunch of the second day, we stopped one hundred meters before the border. We had made it. We walked across the border and made camp on the edge of a wood and the next morning hitchhiked to Thessaloniki.'

Someone shouts, “Fifteen minutes to breakfast” so SIX-FORTY-FIVE is breakfast. Rice pudding or muesli or the unfortunate period of polenta. The coffee mug moves jealously between hands and we crowd around the map to see the route for the day. Two hours of walking. Whatever you felt this morning shifts as you walk, as if landscape is shaping your thoughts. The open space lets your mind roam with nothing to touch on except trees and fields. If the walking is easy we spread out and have time to be alone, or else you fall into step with someone and have a chance to get to know each other beyond the schedule or who’s cooking that night or where we should camp. We’re all individuals coming from different interests and the tight schedule doesn’t always allow for that to shine through. FIVE is dinner preparation, but some people disappear into their tents. FIVE-THIRTY is dinnertime, and has us sitting around the fire again in a circle, meeting each other again, bringing our mismatched bowls and throwing salt across the fire. Weather-permitting, the conversation lingers into stories. We share our pasts and see each other beyond the daily, small things. EIGHT or EIGHT-THIRTY, we’re in bed after we’ve sung around the fire. Some of us stay up reading in our tents, but it’s the earliest we’ve gone to bed since grade school. The sun has gone down, so we fall into the natural rhythm of our bodies.

Two hours of walking, then morning study session. That is, unless we’re having a meeting. A meeting about the shared money, or a study check-in, or a chance to rewrite the manifesto about what the project means to each of us. Or, unless we are hitch-hiking, and spread out over the roads and cities, stopping in cafes to have coffees and use the internet. We become scattered over the landscape and our attention is pulled between the shops and buildings and chances to spend money again, to check your email again, and read the news again. We disappear from each other behind our iPhones and computers. Our individual lives become obviously distinct again, separated from the moving mass we’d become. But FIVE-THIRTY is dinnertime - no matter what has happened that day. Home is a new beach, a new orchard, another field. The rhythm is consistent in an inconsistent landscape. We’re throwing salt across the fire and eating out of mismatched bowls, and when the group is working well together you can hear it in our voices when we sing before bed.
