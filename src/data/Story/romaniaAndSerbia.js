We needed a day here to plan our route through Romania as maps had been impossible to find until then. For the second time on the journey we found ourselves paying for accommodation, this time at the International Camping, which gave us unlimited internet and easy access to the city center. The woods around the camping were sparse, but felt comforting after the hustle and bustle of Budapest.'

In between playing music, Nola drew all of our portraits. Anna’s passion for food made a marked improvement in the Classroom Alive kitchen. Adding to all this was Michael, whose every ounce of being radiated expressive art and deep abiding love. '

When each student joined we had had individual conversations inviting them to give what they felt they could in relation to the overall costs. This, however, was the first time we had sat down as the whole group who were walking all the way to Athens (and a few who were coming most of the way) to talk about money. After an update on the Classroom Alive financial situation, each of us spoke about our personal relationship to money. What our families’ relationship to money was, whether we tended towards saving or spending, how we related to surplus, deficit and debt, what we needed to be comfortable, where we felt we could lean into a stretch, and what we needed in order to feel safe. It was a heartening and terrifying experience to speak openly about these things and enlightening to hear everyone’s stories and realize all the different ways we related to matters of money.'

It was important because it helped all of us to balance the principle of solidarity with that of freedom - solidarity because we were all sharing, freedom because we are all unique individuals with unique desires and needs. From buying coffee and ice-cream to buying sustainable and local, we had to find a balance with the limited resources available. We talked about how judgement and jealousy can arise in these situations and each spoke what we would need in order to feel free in this regard.'

Banking was conceived in iniquity and born in sin. Bankers were conceived in inequity and born in sin. Bankers own the earth; take it away from them, but leave them with the power to create credit, and with the stroke of a pen they will create enough money to buy it back again... If you wish to remain slaves of Bankers, and pay the cost of your own slavery, let them continue to create deposits."'

Although we knew very little about her, we had read her letter of intent aloud as a group while in Hungary and so everybody knew she was from Alaska. As we had been warned about bears in the upcoming forests, having her and River there as representatives of Alaska was reassuring.  In preparation, we had acquired four cans of bear spray and decided that we would stash our food in the trees after dark and pitch our tents far away from our cooking area, or as we called it, ‘the kitchen’. We shimmied up some trees with some bags of food, and although our climbing skills would hardly have challenged a bear, it offered us a degree of comfort. In the morning we were ready to get moving again and we hitchhiked to Resita.'

Lunch and studying happened just below a cave, which distracted us from studying books, but taught us about the incredible depths of silence and darkness. After lunch the rain that had been threatening all morning started to fall. The “trail” led up a canyon scattered with huge trees and boulders and we sang “Down by the River Side” and other songs to keep our spirits up as we continued on through these seldom-visited hillsides blanketed by woods with partially-marked trails that had long since become overgrown.'

After considerable deliberation and perseverance Kai and Mischa found the trail again down a hill amongst enormous ancient trees. We followed the trail down to another logging road where we found a table and benches as aged and wild-looking as the surrounding woods. Following the road in search of our trail, we found some loggers and their horses near a camp of trailers.'

After much back and forth, they seemed to understand where we wanted to go and indicated back the way we had come.

The silence of the night was deafening. Finally we started to find more and more of what our map said should be there. As we came down into a valley we found subsistence farmers living off the land, and when we spread our tents to dry in a field we had to guard them against the free-roaming domestic pigs who found them fantastic toys.'

After a couple days of walking through the valley we prepared to head back into the hills towards the town of Ravensca. The night before we were to leave the valley, Mathijs and Sebastian announced they were going to hitchhike ahead due to illness. The next morning, just as we were about to start walking, the team who had gone to find water came back with reports of cute puppies on a farm. After a lengthy discussion, a few returned to the farm and joined the group at lunch with a little Romanian shepherd dog. She was christened Atena after our destination, which now became hers as well.'

After gathering plums, pears, and blackberries from a nearby pasture, and beer from the local store, we sat down to dinner as a storm appeared on the horizon and clouds swept towards us. That night lightening flashed all around us and the winds howled. As the rain beat against our tarp and flowed around our tents everything got at least a bit damp, but our trusty homes protected us from the worst of it. In the morning, in the fresh air following the storm, we walked down out of the mountains to meet the Danube once more, this time on the Romanian/Serbian border, at Luibcova. It was a three hundred kilometer hitchhike to our next starting point, Temska, Serbia, and it took a full two days to cover the distance as the roads were small and rides hard to come by.'

Every decision regarding which book to read next was made at the conclusion of the book previous to it and over time a certain red thread had shown itself. This thread had three strands and led me to the autobiographies of a series of significant individuals in Europe and the United States whose lives stretched from the beginning of the seventeenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century.'

This strand of “Viewpoints in Fiction” was continued later with Jack Kerouac’s ‘On the Road’.'

This book is a whirlwind tour through the history of the western canon of thought.  It begins with the early Greek philosophers, and then follows the rise of Christianity, Islam, the Renaissance, the Romantics, and the Industrial Revolution, and ends with Environmentalism and Feminism in the late twentieth century. With this as my backdrop, I read some David Hume to examine more closely the rise of materialism. From Hume, I proceeded to Martin Buber, an anthroposophically inspired philosopher who approaches the theme of varying narratives as they are experienced within human consciousness. Together with a number of other texts on philosophy, economics, and politics, these rounded off my theoretical inquiry.'

Retrospectively, two things struck me about this. The first was that I had moved through this list mostly chronologically (i.e. historically), and the second was that it included biographies from men living in most of the major western powers (Germany, Austria, France, Great Britain, and the United States) and fit together as a sort of modern history of the west before the world wars. From the individual texts, I gained many insights into the theme of narratives by noticing the unique way that each person narrated their own life. In some cases, after finding common stories in the lives of the authors, it was also possible to see how those stories have grown and penetrated into the world I now live in. Some of the striking examples of stories running through all of their lives were around themes of morality, utility, and materialism.'

          content: 'One final crucial element of my studies was the role that my peers played in helping me to work with my curriculum. An example of this comes from a conversation I had with Mathijs while we were in Slovakia. As I was speaking to him about one of the thoughts I was working with, he asked me to extrapolate. I explained that I thought “if we really pay attention to the different ways in which everybody relates to the shared world we inhabit, we can see that so much of that relationship is built out of the stories we tell ourselves about the world.” To this he replied, “but then, isn’t that just a story as well? Isn’t that just how YOU are relating to the world? Does that mean that everybody is?” At the time that we were having this conversation I knew there was something incomplete in what I was thinking about and his point helped me to see an area of the worldview of stories that needs further examination. I continued to think about this over the trip and found that at the conclusion of the journey my studies were still not complete.'

          content: 'After the physical journey of Classroom Alive was complete, I continued working with these questions for some time. Two elements in particular helped me to come to a new understanding of my questions. The first was Ken Wilber’s “Sex, Ecology, and Consciousness” which explores the question of multiple perspectives and stories from the angle of the development of consciousness. The second was a conversation with a friend, while sitting on my front porch one night. Suddenly the penny dropped and I found a definition for the concept of societal narratives. In the context of how I was exploring it, societal narratives are the general fields of conversation surrounding a particular subject matter. As soon as we as individuals distinguish a part from the whole, “Tree”, “Food”, “Israel”, we begin a conversation about it. These conversations intersect and overlap. “Israel” overlaps heavily with “Palestine”, but the point is that it is these conversations that make up our societal relationship to these “parts”. Those who believe one or another thing about a particular subject are simply attentive to and creating different parts of the conversation.'

          content: 'To draw out the larger implications of this would take much longer, but at the most basic level this can be made practical by illustrating how it applies to social process on an ongoing basis. The extent to which there is dissonance is the extent to which people are unable to understand or participate in the whole of a conversation. In other words, unable to understand what other people are bringing. This has been said many times by many different people and I do not believe that this will revolutionize the world of communication. But the purpose for me is not the impact that this can have as a social theory. The purpose is the process I went through in learning about this, approaching it from many different angles and asking many different questions to try to build a field of understanding. Out of this field of understanding I carry forward with me my next questions, about what enables and disables people from being able to perceive, understand, and participate in the whole conversation'

Climbing up towards an artificial lake in the mountains for lunch, the landscape was exquisite, rough, and raw. We passed through one village, Pokrevenik, which seemed a relic from another century. As we made our way up, shepherds and their flocks dotted the hillside. Coming over the top of a hill in Pokrevenik, our eyes grew wide and we grew quiet. Old women walked haltingly along muddy roads carrying water from the well. Everywhere onions, peppers, and garlic were hanging to dry. In the distance, a chainsaw engine roared, breaking the silence. The population was one hundred and twenty-six, according to the census, and we saw few people under fifty years old. By the time we made it to the lake, a change occurred. As we walked along the banks looking for camp that afternoon, we passed many new cottages and fancy cars; the air smelled of new construction.'

Secondly, our map was becoming less dependable. While the topography seemed correct, the trails on the map went to different places than the map said they would.

At two and a half months old she could not manage the incline, so she was picked up and carried on shoulders on top of packs. She had quickly grown to be part of our village, but it was not all smooth sailing. The night before a local dog, who had been following us for a few days, had ripped open the plastic bag with her stuff in it and ate all the dog food we had for her. When we finally got to the top of the ridge and sat down for lunch, we had to feed her our mornings leftovers - the burnt oatmeal scraped off the bottom of the pot. From then on, she would often eat our leftovers if we were low on dog food, but some days she would choke on it because she was eating too fast. Then somebody would yell for Madalena, who would come running and shake Atena upside down until whatever was stuck came out. The first few times it happened it was a heart-stopping experience!'

Just after we re-united with them, we were called out of the café we were sitting in by the local police.
