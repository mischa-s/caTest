Our fifth student was Doug, Mischa’s father, who at sixty-three was the oldest student to join the walk. After a few days Mischa and Doug left temporarily for Mischa’s sister’s wedding and we became a group of three – Caleb, Mathijs, and Madalena.'

We had no need to worry about water because soon we would pass a house; no need to worry about places to camp because soon we would find a forest; we had no need to worry about trails because our path was perfectly marked and the names of the villages left no space for doubt. The mono-cultural landscape forced us to find diversity in our studies, and we found adventure by sharing these at dinner or through Homer, who followed Herman Hesse as our evening storyteller.'

They seemed to be on a mission to show us what a home away from home looked like, and became parents for all three of us for a weekend. When it was Monday and time for school again, fifteen kilometers by the banks of the river Lužnice led us to the bohemian capital, Tabor, where Shirin joined us. She was one of the first to commit to joining the walk, before it was even really known what it would be, and had been at YIP with Madalena during the preparation phase. '

The discipline of our days made the unknown both tempting and intimidating. One day Mathijs said, “I have a crazy Idea. What if we hitchhike further so that we can walk in a natural park for two days?” It was a crazy idea in our world of walking and studying, and with crazy ideas came crazy events. We met a man who guided us through the underground tunnels of Slavonice, and then breakfasted out. That night we took refuge from a raging thunderstorm in a church filled with children’s laughter and the overwhelmingly light smiles of nuns.'

The sun was shining, the vineyards were endless, and we agreed to meet at the village church before lunch. Ernst joined us there and we became five. An easy going and jovial fellow, he soon got behind the lens of the camera and for the duration of his time walking with us would often be filming and taking pictures. '

The sun shone so brightly as to completely overwhelm all of our senses, but as we walked into village after village, people welcomed us with hospitality, schnapps, and shade in their cellars. As the sun continued to shine brightly the blackberries became sweet, the cherries dark red, and the plums big and juicy. We had forgotten about supermarkets being closed on Sundays and so we became “hunter-gatherers” for some days, picking wild fruits and exchanging blackberries for rice and pasta. For three days we lived on the gifts of people and the land.'

In still moments, on a rest day or when we have stayed for a night in a city, it is hard not to have the slow, sneaking feeling, that perhaps the momentum, the call for movement, will not let us ever stay still again, our feet now awake. Perhaps upon arriving in Athens, ignoring all plans, leading us onwards, our feet will simply carry us right over the edge of the world…'

The night came with rain and lightning; making up for all of the sunshine, the storm giving all the water back to the fields, forests and rivers. The next day the sun was shining again, more strongly than had ever been registered in that area. We slowly walked down the mountain to meet the river Danube and the ten people who would join us in Vienna to walk together with us for the next chapter.'

In the center of large development where an old airport is becoming a new part of the city, Sprungbutt Aspurn is a little wooded oasis of alternative living. For the Node itself, we partnered with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). As we settled into our temporary home, the Open Week participants began to arrive in ones and twos, and Mischa returned. The Node was a one day event about (Bio)diversity, held at the WWF headquarters. We were a fluctuating group of twenty-five. In the morning, through games and presentations we learned from the folks at the WWF about the work they do around biodiversity and why it is such an important topic for them. In the afternoon, some of the Classroom Alive students talked about diversity from the perspective of our studies. The similarities were striking. We saw the same trends laid out in the morning concerning our environmental situation in a presentation by Shirin on our systems for higher education , in Mathijs’ presentation on the films we create , and in Caleb’s presentation on the way our economic system functions . We found the same prevailing stories in all sectors. Stories of tried and true efficiency based on mechanistic thinking with little room for creativity, experimentation, or adaptation to the real needs of people or the planet.'

Walking with so many, conversation was constant and the pace was slow, but on the other hand, the excitement and energy was enough to blow our socks off. When we made camp, we created a village. Some of those who joined would stay longer, but those just with us for the Open Week jumped right into the adventure with full force. Marcela, Till, Matthieu, Seth, Nola, and Elisa brought deep questioning and passion, and were always happy to help with the little things like grocery shopping, which now approached forty kilograms for just two days’ worth of food. When we sang, a veritable choir rattled the branches and swayed the trees that stood on the banks of the Danube. In the morning and after lunch, we sang rousers, songs to get the heart pumping and move your feet. In the evening our singing softened, slowly fading into silence at the close of the day.'

The first was George the Last, the third in a line of Georges to run the restaurant Humer's Uferhaus, where the specialty was fresh fish. His two daughters played around us on the patio of the restaurant as we made use of the internet and tables and chairs to study. We pitched our tents in his orchard and had our first studies presentation of the Open Week on his lawn, aboard a mock pirate ship built by journeymen carpenters. The theme of the presentation was ‘Gifting and the Music Industry,’ presented by Seth."

She was the only other person we encountered who was on a walking journey similar to ours in length. Where we camped with her and her companions we had another presentation, this one from Matthieu about his work with Anthroposophy and with the ideas of leading contemporary anthroposophists such as Arthur Zjionc, Otto Scharmer, and Nicanor Perlas. He was carrying many questions about technology which he posed to the group. What if genetic modification and other technological improvements really could enable humanity to take their next steps forward? Can we know already what the potential of current technology is? The accelerating development of recent years suggests endless possibilities. Can we afford to risk the repercussions of those possibilities? Time seemed to pass at half speed as we challenged one another to examine our beliefs from different perspectives.'

We crossed the river and hard feelings from heated discussions were massaged away by the rhythm of footfalls carrying us on towards our next camp. At camp we dug a trench fire in the sand spanning the length of three normal fires in order to prepare a meal that was enough. As we made our way through tangled woods along the river, suddenly the colours on our map changed and we had to stop to take a picture. We were crossing from Austria into Slovakia.'

We shook it for all it was worth, using our tarp to catch its sweet offerings. As we walked towards the center of the city we tried to share our good fortune with the people we passed. Most wouldn’t look at us, a few politely declined, and once in a while somebody would enthusiastically accept. It was Friday and we hoped to rest in the city for a couple of days, so after lunch, we spread out from the middle of Bratislava in every direction to search for accommodation. We tried the fire halls, the churches, the monasteries, the university, and the Waldorf School. A couple of teachers from the Waldorf School were there and said we were welcome to camp in their yard and use the fire pit for the weekend. We relaxed into the peaceful grounds, saying goodbye to many of our Open Week participants who would leave us there.'

The world comes more alive. There are no answers to abstract questions like you find in a normal classroom, instead you start to get at the life behind things. If 'slow' wasn't such an overused term, I'd say this is Slow Education in the tradition of Slow Food and Slow Money. It's about getting into the quality of things, not just racing to consume a greater and greater quantity of information."

I'm now drawn deeper into the layers of things, into the step, that leads to another step, that keeps pointing to something more - to a mystery behind things that is waiting to be revealed if we'll only be patient enough and interested enough and walk slowly enough to meet it."
