Missing nature and feeling thoroughly overwhelmed by the big city we said goodbye to River, and welcomed the last student who would join all the way to Athens, Manik. A few months later Manik would become part of the calling group for the next Classroom Alive, Classroom Alive: Ireland.'

      content: 'Having assembled as the group that would travel for the whole duration of Greece we took public transport from Thessaloniki to Neoi Poroi, and tucked our feet into the golden sand - summer had come again. From here, we followed the coast and, wherever possible, walked barefoot along the beach. When rocky shoreline replaced the soft sand, we hiked up and down, bobbing along the natural curvature of the canyons of rivers and streams etched into the coastline. Lunch was always by the water; the crystal blue sea was still warm from a long summer of sun. The sun continued to shine for us day after day, but as we came closer to Mount Pelion and the days grew shorter, the sun’s warmth turned to shadows earlier and earlier. After our adventures high up in the mountains, we found our daily rhythm again.'

      content: 'In Pelion the sandy beaches became fewer and farther between, and our route became more woodland trails and backwoods dirt roads. We climbed up to the town of Keramidi for groceries, headed back to the coast, then climbed once more away from the blessed sea to reach Veneto. Here we encountered a village that was unlike any others we had passed. There was only one café and no market or grocery store. The people of the town live mostly subsistence lifestyles. One man who spoke a little German helped us find a German ex-pat couple, who informed us that the closest grocery store was where we had just come from, a day and a half of walking one way. The first road connecting the ancient town to the national highway system was built in the 1980s, they told us. We could stretch what food we had for another 36 hours, but by then we would most definitely need supplies.'

      content: 'After a long conference about our options, the German couple spoke with the owner of the café in Greek, who agreed to open early for us to eat dinner there that night. Our sunrise and sunset schedule were foreign to the Mediterranean gastronomic habits and we generally went to bed about the time the café usually opened.  In the meantime, the couple showed us to a German Scouts outpost where we could set up our tents for the night. The property, with terraced patios, an outdoor kitchen, and a fairy tale view over the sea momentarily weakened our resolve to push for Athens – why would we ever go somewhere else when we could study in a place like this? As we sat contemplating our options the man informed us that his wife had convinced him to do some errands in the city that he had been putting off. This meant that the following morning he had to drive to Volos, a large city an hour away, and he could take one or two people with him if we liked. We quickly decided to take a rest day there, as it was the perfect union of practical and beautiful. The kindness and warmth they showed us unequivocally qualified them as angels in our books.'

      content: 'In seemingly no time at all we were back on the trail again and soon a new proposal came forward from the study stewards: mentor groups. Small consistent groups to help mentor each other in our study process. We had been working with mentor circles with the whole group for a few months, but the suggestion was to create small groups of three or four that met every week in addition to sharing our studies with the whole group. The wide dirt roads helped facilitate experimenting with this and it proved immensely successful in helping us to really take time to support one another’s studies.'

      content: 'It was also around this time that we started noticing an increased intensity in our conversations. Some days were grumpy days and a mood spread through the group that was enjoyably gruff. Other days we were meeting one another with new fascination. As we discussed our studies and our lives, worlds of possibility began to unfold. Feeling the pressure of the end so close, we started to imagine what would come next. What if we would get a farm together somewhere? We started to realize that many of us felt our studies wouldn’t be finished by the time we arrived in Athens – what if we would all move to Portugal to keep studying together? Some days we walked in small groups just because we wanted to talk to one another more. When this happened, Atena would run back and forth between the groups, barking at some to keep up, and then rushing ahead to check on those in front. Miraculously she always found her way to camp at night, although she never paid attention when we went over the map in the morning.'

      content: 'As we approached Volos, the shadow of a new concern itched at our consciousness: we were literally becoming itchy. Fleas had been found on Atena and we had sprayed her to get rid of them but when we shook our sleeping bags the tiny insects turned up in our gear as well. Our new plan was to find a campground with a laundromat. The day before we were to walk into Volos, we passed a hotel and hatched a ridiculous plan. What if we would stay at the hotel? The price was manageable and they had laundry service, so a full-scale extermination program began. We carefully executed a plan to minimize contamination, not entering the rooms until the first load of laundry was done, and then immediately showering and bagging what we had been wearing. At night when the rest of the laundry was done, we spread everything outside, sprayed it with flea killing chemicals and bagged it for 48 hours. After three nights at the hotel, we continued down the western coast of the Pagasetic gulf, bypassing Volos on its eastern side.'

      content: 'We were bound for Axaladitsa, home of the Living Wholeness Institute. We had originally thought of going there when we were planning the journey, but communication hadn’t worked out. Then while we were at the hotel contact was established and we were invited to come spend some time. We sheepishly showed up on their doorstep and insisted that we would stay outside. We couldn’t guarantee the success of our extermination program. They would have none of it - welcoming, mothering, mentoring, coaching, and befriending us all at once. Whatever plans we had for our time there melted as richness of the meeting took over.'

The grace with which we were not only practically hosted, but also fully met in our story and journey seemed to be exactly what we needed in this time of spiralling towards our end. During the first check-in upon arriving, we might have slightly overused the word "cozy," but it was inevitable, with cats sitting in our laps as the rain poured outside. Over the three days we spent here in what became an emergent Node, we used various group processes to explore our group story moving forward, and we studied together the recent story of Greece in the Euro crisis and its path forward. It cannot be stressed enough how generously we were welcomed and taught here, so much gratitude to the Living Wholeness family, Maria, Vanessa, Claire, Bénédict, the fourteen cats, and Freddy the dog. We can only hope to be able to welcome others with such beauty and kindness someday.'

As soon as we arrived here, something changed, and the slower pace has been a really good chance for deep conversations and reflections."

A secret plan had been hatched by Manik and Vilja in their capacity as the route team for us to kayak from Agi Kiriaki across the bay, but this turned out to be impossible because of the strong winds. Instead, we went by water taxi. We landed on the island of Euboea in Oreoi, and soon were engaged in a joyful exchange with a local café owner. When we left, she insisted on filling our pockets with oranges. This had become the norm as we made our way south, with the abundance of fruit trees leading to an abundance of fresh oranges, pomegranates, and occasionally, kiwis.'

      content: 'In Loutra Edipsou, we made camp in an abandoned building by the sea shore. Here we continued some of the conversations about the Euro crisis that had been started at Axaladitsa and watched a documentary by the BBC on the subject. Talking to locals, we discovered that the building we were staying in had been abandoned because of the Euro crisis. They then proceeded to tell us that it had been used for sulphur baths and we soon discovered that less than fifty meters from us hot sulphur water was gushing out from under the city, a natural hot spring with pools just beyond the reach of the tide. Sitting immersed in the pools and feeling the spray of the sea, with bright stars overhead at night, and in the morning watching the sun slowly rise over the water, the word paradise seemed inadequate. Even when a late night dash into the sea embedded Caleb’s foot with urchin spikes, we pressed on the next day, as our date for arriving in Athens was rapidly approaching. '

      content: 'The sun, our constant companion, seemed to set later now that we were beyond the mountains and midday swims still warmed our bodies - admittedly with a new-found fear of sea urchins. We arrived in Limin, took a short hitch to Khalkis and stared down the last mountains between us and Athens. It was unquestionably bittersweet, but after answering the question “where are you going?” in ten countries along the way, it was incredible to be so close. Nevertheless our studies continued, seemingly intensified now that the end was in sight. We held our final Focus Week on Christine Gruwez’s Walking with Your Time in preparation for a meeting we had arranged with her in Athens. Sitting in olive groves and on rocky hilltops we discussed what it meant to be active and participate in a time where things are so quickly changing and yet still remain grounded.'

      content: 'One last day along the coast and the proximity to industrialized civilization was palpable all around. Finally we bid the sea farewell, walking the next day to the foot of the mountains. We spent one day climbing up into the mountains, took another to cross them, and a third climbing down the other side. Shepherds and their flocks surrounded us one final time as we passed subsistence farmers and walked through wild woods. Our slow reintegration into civilization was unknowingly orchestrated with gradual steps, as in those woods, we would never have known we were so close to a major metropolis. Except at night, when the previously brilliant stars were now dulled by a heavy formless haze. Drinking in the last peace of the forests, we prepared ourselves for a change.'

      content: 'From a high point above the woods our eyes showed us a sprawling mass of buildings; ‘It must be Athens! Our naivety was soon dispelled. It was Aspropyrgos that we saw, a small suburb outside the city, but to our eyes it looked big enough to be the ancient city state. And so we stepped out of the woods for the last time above Fili, and from there we could see Athens proper. The largest city on our walk, our destination. Our final camp was behind an abandoned building in the middle of the town of Fili. That night we drank down the last of the various bottles of homemade alcohol that we had been gifted along the way. The next morning we were up early, despite the pounding in our heads, for our last day of walking. Walking all day, with a break for lunch, we arrived at our final destination at 18:00, on November 29th, 2013.'

      content: 'Arriving in Athens, we were greeted by friends who had flown and driven down from Sweden, Belgium, and Axalidtsa. The journey had proven to be an initiation for all of us who had undertaken it, and our friends had come to help us with what is an essential part of every initiation: the “return.” The first days in the city were some of the most overwhelming of the whole journey. Sleeping in a flat, knowing that the walk was over, in the city sleeping in a flat, knowing that the walk was over… Realizing, it was over. An eerie feeling that after having created a new home almost every night for six months from the north of Europe to the south, things were about to change. What was it that made us feel home all those nights? How would we carry this forward in the big noisy city, so full of smells, buildings, and people? We had a house, but struggled to create home.'

In our exhaustion, we were challenged to discern how we could meet it in the best possible way. Our hostess’s advice: just walk through the city.  So that is what we did, and in the process we found that a fresh and lively pulse can be found amongst the ruins. Within a fifteen minute walking radius from the site of the ancient acropolis, a wide selection of co-working spaces, alternative currency groups, and radical meeting places can be found. In these places, democracy is undergoing heart surgery. Out of our studies, we met with Christine Gruwez for a day to explore the theme of life and form. Her work helped us come to some understanding of what we had just undertaken, of what we had just completed.'

      content: 'The way in which we were able to contribute to the communities we met there was by sharing our story. The last night before we were to leave Athens to head to the Island Aegina, we presented our journey to an intimate crowd who received it very warmly. So much so that when we returned to Athens a week later on our last night together, we presented again, with a similar experience of offering what we could to the city: an inspiration to live one’s dreams and connections to others who similarly strive in other parts of the world. As students, we shared our thirst for forms of education that carry us forward as human beings. At that stage of our studies, so fresh from the road, what we could give was ultimately much more form than content. What we received was their commitment to graciousness and real people-centered politics, economy, and culture.'

Where did this form originate from? What was the seed that grew into a germ at one point? We talked about impulses, motivations and drives. What was the life or the potential in us that created this form – the walk, the journey? How did this germ grow into a blossom? Where did Classroom Alive flourish the most? And which fruits grew out of these flowers? We talked about our summer, about mountains, fears and our crises. What happened in the phase – the black hole – in between flower and fruit? We discovered how the answers to each question can be different and multiple for each of us. After Classroom Alive’s blossoming and fruitful phase how will this form close down into a new seed? What will this new seed look like and what new germ – or also: form – will grow out of this? In other words; what is the life in and behind Classroom Alive – the life in us – that will keep on existing and searching for other and new forms, as this particular one now dissolves?'

A spacious nineteenth century mansion surrounded by olive groves had long been a fanciful dream, a joke thrown out in silly moments. Imagine if we could find a huge house on an island close to Athens where we could work on the documentation of the journey after our arrival. The idea had first come up during the planning phase. We first found out about Oikia Karapanou the day we arrived in Athens. Impossible? Yes. True? Also.'

We had had meetings in the final weeks of walking to plan the time, but now that we were there, we realized that we would only be able to plan the documentation. The actual work would have to come afterwards. Slowly, as the week went by, we found we were at least succeeding in this. When a local magazine came to interview us about the journey, there was plenty to tell.'

Upon our arrival there and part of the reason for our warm welcome, we were met by an educational project being worked on by the owners. They had a dream of filling the house with young people who were given space to connect to their authentic task and gather the tools they would need to really make a go of becoming themselves, rather than becoming generic career number forty-three. They called it, “The School of All Relations”. As our conversations grew around how to help them in shaping this, we started looking at our own process through a new lens.'

We eleven students had ended up together not because we said, “let’s do it with this group,” but because these were the people who responded to the invitation. It could have been anybody. We were so glad it was this group. Then again, it had to be. As the week came to an end, we focused our time in seeing one another fully before the final farewell. We realized what we had learned from one another, what we had taught each other. How we had grown as a team. In the warmth of Oikia Karapanou and surrounded by the warmth of the people there, we began to see one another anew. Not just as part of an amorphous tribe of walkers, but as individuals. Really awesome individuals whom we loved. Whom we loved because we had gone through the hard parts together, celebrated the joys together, and ultimately knew something of the gifts that each one carried. After the time and experiences together, it was impossible not to. Our last day together we returned to Athens to give this to those who came to hear us that night as we presented one more time, and that night, December 15th, at 23:50 we began heading our separate ways.'
