      content: 'We had met while attending the International Youth Initiative Program (YIP) in Järna, Sweden in 2010-2011. Throughout the program we had concocted various schemes together, but at the end of the year we all went our separate ways. We stayed loosely in touch, however, and when Caleb published a website in the spring of 2012 declaring his intention to study and asking the world to hold him accountable, Mathijs and Mischa were among those who responded. As conversations progressed around where and how to study, the three of us committed to do it together and in the fall of 2012 the picture of walking across Europe began to take shape. The greatest challenge was that we were literally an ocean apart, with Caleb in Los Angeles, Mathijs in Belgium and Mischa in Sweden. Over the winter we had talked on a weekly basis and finally we managed to come together in the same location at the end of February 2013.'

      content: 'We began working on the project full-time at the beginning of March, in Järna, as the brilliant sunshine glinted off the snow-covered fields and fjords for the last month of winter. As the snow slowly melted and the ice covering the fjord began to crack, we found ourselves in a dream studio where we lived and worked together. It was equipped with a ping pong table, dart board, and enough internet to do what needed doing, but evasive enough to discourage abuse.'

          content: 'Our day starts with a giant pot of porridge, eaten happily while staring out big windows on the still white Swedish spring. After our eight forty-five daily morning singing, (which is still sounding mostly in the tradition of a late night drinking tune but is on a journey to become something more choral) we dig into a morning meeting. During the morning session in which diagrams are drawn, points are made, chests are beaten, and clear concepts are wrestled from the caves of our imagination, we do the heavy lifting of transforming three different imaginations of an excellent learning adventure into one clear framework of what is to be Classroom Alive. The afternoon is spent individually developing the hard-earned concepts and how we can implement them. Evenings are always a dance between a little bit of good old plain tea time talks, and the occasional late night revelation.'

      content: 'Perhaps the most important aspect of the studio was simply the vast space that it provided. It had high ceilings, and was wide and long. The walls seemed stretched to the limit at times as each of us brought all of our selves, habits, and visions to meet those of the other two. Slowly, the incongruences became harmonious and we learned how to host one another, letting each one’s light shine. Our focus began to grow acute and an upcoming task appeared on the horizon. Big chart papers covered in half-formed thoughts and ideas, with circles and lines drawn across, around, and through them, changed into small textboxes on a website, now under construction. Initiative Forum 2013 (an international conference attracting 200+ young people happening just down the road from our studio) was less than two weeks away and we needed a coherent vision and a web presence to articulate the vision, so we disappeared behind our computers to generate form and content. The forum arrived, and after a month of being cooped up together we hardly saw each other all week amidst the waves of new and old friends.'

      content: 'After the forum and after recovering from its attendant fatigue, we found ourselves forty-five days from the starting line. The to-do list included fundraising, finding trails, finding places to stay, creating the process and framework for other students to join, and a million and one odd jobs. On reflection, we discovered that what this entailed was a full immersion into the land of computers for the remainder of our time there, before leaving them behind for the six month journey.'

      content: 'Although the days became quite focused, the account would not be complete without mentioning the many late night fires afforded us by the Swedish spring, the late night study groups, warm-hearted men’s circles, and early morning singing. Indeed, as the initial pieces fell into place and the time for leaving drew nigh, it became harder and harder to leave. But with a final barbeque with good friends, good food, singing and conversation, the open road beckoned. Finally, on Sunday, May 26th, after a hearty breakfast, we hitched up our packs and hit the trail.'
