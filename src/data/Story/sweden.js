      content: 'And so our little troupe set out, three of us bound for Greece, and Kim, Matisse, and River to send us on our way. Sunshine lit our way as we set off down the road, but by our first break the rain had arrived. We made our way along the local Baltic fjord, and our first challenge came as we sought a way through fields plush with rainfall and nearly submerged roads. As we tested the way the first boot slipped through the mud and filled with water, and a short while later we made camp. We talked long into the night around our opening campfire, marking the beginning of our way into the unknown with our friends who had come to witness our leaving. The next morning we bid farewell to Kim and Matisse, and set off as four into the woods. During those first days, much time and energy was asked by the simple task of stepping into the lifestyle we had chosen and learning the ropes. We were frequently grateful to the stewards of the Sormlandsleden, our trail, for the well-marked paths that guided us through beautiful and enchanting forests. Their sturdy three-walled shelters welcomed us home most days, and were often equipped with an axe, firewood, a grill, a broom, breathtaking views, and pristine lakes for swimming and laundry.'

      content: 'As we settled into the comforts that this marvellous trail afforded us, we had to say goodbye to our last friend who had set out with us. River had carried the heavy special treats such as chocolate, whiskey, cigarettes, and mayo. His parting feast was pizza, driven down from Järna by some friends and future students. And as they vanished into the night, the three of us looked at each other with an unmistakable feeling - it is now begun. We walked the whole next day in silence, except to attend to practicalities, to give ourselves the space to arrive in what lay before us.'

      content: 'For the next ten days we continued to be blessed by magical and welcoming woods, lakes and shelters. During this time our studies began to find form. We settled into the walking and started playing with the study sessions. First thing in the morning, before lunch, after lunch, before dinner, after dinner – what feels right? We stayed in one beautiful place after the next, and leaving each morning seemed madness, yet each day new beauty was revealed, hidden in thick mossy forests of pine. After experimenting a bit with our studies we began our first focus week, a whirlwind tour through the history and development of western thought, courtesy of Richard Tarnas. As we sat by lakes and in hidden groves, reclining with our e-readers, one or another would spring up, cry out in amazement and proceed to expound some facet of the development of Christianity or the founding of universities or the rise of materialism that had sparked our passion. Conversations were full of discussions of these things and most meals began with the question “What did you read about today?” or “What did you think about today?” Often times the second question brought recollections from our pasts, which were shared with humour and wonder.'

          content: 'When I decided to join Classroom Alive, I began to research the different ways of doing self-directed studies. According to the commonly accepted best practices for learning, there are four important steps. The first is to specify a manageable subject area. The second is to design an approach to the subject. Third, you must find support in the form of mentors and other interested parties who can help you deepen your research. Finally, you must communicate your learning or “teach” to solidify what has been learned.'

          content: 'I immediately felt the truth of this and also knew that it was not how I would conduct my studies. Many self-directed students find this approach helpful and perhaps I would be able to observe this process in my path of learning retrospectively, but I chose a different guide. I wanted to do self-directed studies because questions burned in me that I wanted to learn about. What the questions were, however, was not clear to me. Somebody once gave me the picture of rowing a boat, wherein once the general direction is established, one steers based on landmarks that lie behind, in other words, based on where one has come from. For me the goal on the horizon has always been to understand and shape societal dynamics, but this will likely remain forever a speck in the distance. What lies behind is more clearly defined.'

          content: 'For the last ten years I have woven a path of interest, learning about and experiencing politics, economics, food systems and social process. Then I became interested in the “stories” told about each of these respective fields. So in setting my landmarks for my Classroom Alive studies, I selected two stories  — ‘anthroposophy’ and ‘materialism,’ — and examined their contributions to several topics: ‘food systems,’ ‘finding common ground,’ and ‘the role of the individual in society.’ All this needed a name, and from what I could make out at the time it looked to me like ‘Societal Narratives,’ so that is what I called it. Vague as these landmarks may seem, they gave me the direction I needed to compose a library built around the writings, contemporaries, and influences of David Hume and Rudolf Steiner. By consulting others who had engaged with these questions in their own ways, I put together a small collection, totalling nearly one hundred e-books. Then I set off, full of curiosity.'

      content: 'There was, however, one part of those woods that felt like a dark secret. Hidden from the highways, our trail led us through many clear-cut forests. As we bid the last of the lakes farewell, the devastation we witnessed lay heavy in our hearts. The visceral experience of the landscape marked by scars from the huge machines was one part of this, but it also brought back conversations we had had throughout the spring with people in the community about biodiversity and forest management - in particular with one man who has devoted his life to bringing awareness to these questions. Walking day by day through that landscape brought home the fact that what nature had built up over many years was being destroyed by us humans in mere hours.'

      content: 'But our path lay ahead, and as the sun sped us on our way south we walked off the Sormlandsladen into a gas station just outside Norrköping, and stuck out our thumbs. We caught a ride south with some young guys from Azerbaijan who shared their story of growing up in a very different culture and of their integration into Swedish culture before dropping us off at a gas station in Jönköping. While our next few rides carried us slowly to the coast to begin the southern leg of our time in Sweden, we talked with the drivers about what we were doing, which gave us the opportunity to reflect a bit on our first couple of weeks. Despite the blisters on our feet and the raw skin on our hips, we began to see how this lifestyle on which we had embarked was beginning to support our studies.'

      content: 'We arrived at Fögel Sång farm late one evening and, for the first time since leaving Järna two weeks previously, found ourselves in a home, surrounded by children’s toys, and treated to use of a laundry machine, hot showers, and a kitchen. In the evenings we were met joyfully with homemade elderberry wine and a country string band, the soft thumping of the bass straying out between the barns and the dancing fiddles singing out across the open fields. The daytime was filled with e-mails and planning and in no time at all we were off to the coast to meet the sea in Kivik. '

      content: 'Over the next ten days we accompanied the Baltic, at times along the Scånaleden (our new trail) and at times along the beach, basking in the bright spring sun of southern Sweden. We made our way through nature reserves full of chirping birds and past empty summer homes competing for the view. The sun’s warm rays were forever softened by the cool sea breeze, coming off waters just warm enough for swimming. In short, what we had found was the perfect study climate, and on more than one occasion we found table and chairs set out overlooking the sea, with no owner in sight, always with the right number of places for all of us.'

          content: 'It’s 10:30 and you have just finished the morning walking session: welcome to your first classroom of the day. The sun is shining, and the breeze sweeping off the ocean cools your hot face. Our classroom is always alive because we are always choosing it. It is always an arriving. As you drop your pack your body seems to rush with lightness (it’s not always the case, but today you are on fire.) The movement of your legs, which carried you the eight kilometers you travelled this morning, has poured into your thoughts. As you sit down, resting against your pack, the words seem to grow as richly and fully as the forests you just walked through. The bird song and your steady breathing, which connected you to the world this morning, are still alive and they weave your thoughts together with all they touch. As you fly off to all corners of the worlds of thought, now and then you look up from your reading to see what the ocean has to add to your morning lecture.'

      content: 'During the day, our conversation drifted between our studies and our thoughts while walking, but also the feeling of the impossibility of what we were doing. That it seemed to be working was a constant source of wonderment. Walking with three had begun to feel normal, but how it would work when more people joined was a mystery to us. The impossibility applied to our studies, but equally so to the financing. When we set out from Järna, we did not have enough money to complete the trip, but as we walked it arrived in trickles and bursts. Nearly every time one of us connected in to the internet we would return with a sparkle in our eyes, the excitement nearly uncontrollable. We’re getting there, we’re almost there, we now have enough money to make it to Greece! On a frugal budget of course, but one day Mathijs put into words what we were all thinking, ‘Guys, imagine if we actually make it to Greece!?’'

In the evenings, we sat around the campfire and would read Herman Hesse’s “Journey to the East” aloud together and then stare in awe at the blanket of stars overhead as we drifted off into tired sleep.'

Indeed, as the time for leaving Sweden approached, it was hard to imagine a more perfect study environment than the one we were leaving behind. But we had made an appointment; two students whom we didn’t know were to meet us in Neuruppin, so we hopped on the night ferry, full of nervous wonder about what was to come.'
