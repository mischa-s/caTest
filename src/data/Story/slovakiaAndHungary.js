Among those who had joined for the rest of the journey and had walked out of Vienna were Madalena, Shirin, and Anna, and walking for at least a month each were Michael, Ernst, and Skye.'

In between playing music, Nola drew all of our portraits. Anna’s passion for food made a marked improvement in the Classroom Alive kitchen. Adding to all this was Michael, whose every ounce of being radiated expressive art and deep abiding love. '

Asking what each of us needed in moving forward we set about trying to imagine, explore, and integrate the different visions each of us carried.'

Our first night we camped on the banks of the Danube in a huge windstorm that shook the branches overhead and caused us to sleep a little fretfully in the flimsy protection offered by our tents. The next morning we crossed the river and experimented with having a walking-meeting as we planned the upcoming Node in Budapest.  We crossed back to the left side of the river across a boat lock, and camp was found in the sand next to an old mine. The group decided for a spontaneous rest day there to help Skye, who was feeling sick, recover a bit. When we set off two days later we were seven as Seth and Nola were hitchhiking back to Vienna, to continue their own journeys and Skye and Ernst were hitchhiking ahead to Komarno to recover their health.'

We had been reading the Odyssey out loud at night around the fire, but the mosquitos got so bad at dusk that we were forced to squeeze, all seven of us, into the biggest tent we had (a spacious two person). The rhythm of the day was ingrained and study time was focused, but the monotony of the flat, straight, endless concrete snake that we walked along made most of us restless. How we longed for a wooded trail, studded with roots and rocks to be navigated.'

At lunch in Komarno we met up with Skye and Ernst and began searching for a place to make camp. After much discussion, we decided to pay for a shower and roof for the first time on our trip. We checked into the Panorama hotel and, taking advantage of the low prices in Slovakia, went to dinner in an exquisite cellar restaurant. We slept late, enjoying the phenomenon of beds and being inside. Then it was across the border into Hungary and two days of walking along roads with cars frequently speeding past and we were in Tata, where we met the students for the third and final Open Week of the journey, from Tata to Budapest.'

To realize what adventure was waiting for me. Now, after four weeks, I find myself crossing the border between holidays and a way of living. My tent, a little one person tent, became my room in a bigger house called Classroom Alive with the world as our backyard. I love the moment in the morning when I crawl out of my tent, feeling the fresh and cold dew between my toes, waking up my feet for a day full of walking. Or the afternoon, lying in my tent ‐ unfortunately too small to sit straight ‐ studying, hearing the tapping rain, while the smell of dinner tickles my senses.'

We found a small park with a gazebo in which to take shelter and when the sun came out we began drying our gear. We received no shortage of funny looks as we covered the gazebo in socks and underwear and occupied all of the grass we could find spreading shirts, jackets, pants, and tents. When a family happened to pass through, the little girl came out holding her nose. She had a point; we hadn’t done laundry in a few weeks. '

When we reported back, Skye and Anna had made friends with an old lady who had a small room in her house and Shirin and Michael had gone to the mayor’s office. In the end, it was Couch Surfing that came through. A local English teacher called and told us about a cabin in the woods fifteen kilometers away that he and his friends had built. He drove us there in two carloads just as it was getting dark. The cabin wasn’t accessible by car, so the first load waited on the edge of the woods until he came back with the other half of the group. When we were all gathered, we followed him up a steep hill in the dark for another fifteen minutes. Following this complete stranger deep into the Hungarian woods, we did our best to suppress unsettling feelings, believing this was an honest man. The cabin turned out to be beautifully situated and was the perfect spot for us to gear up for the next phase of our journey, the walk into Budapest. Our host, an enthusiastic caver, gave us maps and pointed out many trails we could take through the hills before leaving us alone. '

Of the other students, Jenny was an old friend to many of us walking, Laura was a new friend who knew none of us but quickly fit right in, and Kai was a wooden boat builder from the west coast of the United States and didn’t know how long he would walk for. In the end, he walked all the way to Athens. '

We clambered up steep inclines to breathtaking views before lightly dropping down the other side, through orchards and vineyards and into quaint villages. Life was beautiful. To feel the ache in your legs as you climb, to feel the wind on your face at the top, to taste the freshness of an apple just picked, and to nestle home into the bosom of the next hill each night. When we stopped for lunch in villages and went in search of water, we became accustomed to the fact that we might receive homemade wine and other delights as well. One time we even found a student, when Vilja caught up with us towards the end of a day. She had been at YIP with Shirin and Madalena, and was a walking embodiment of the notion of Sweden to Greece - a native of the former studying the language of the latter - and would walk all the way to Athens.'

Having seen vast inhabitations from the hilltops, we were in forests all the way to the outskirts of the city where we camped the last evening. The next morning we entered the vast metropolis and promptly lost one another, with three different groups making their way into the city on different paths. We reconvened on the banks of the Danube before finding our “home” in the heart of downtown Budapest, just a few blocks from the river.'
