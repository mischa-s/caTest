          content: 'When we arrived in Neuruppin we started asking around for a roof to sleep under. But in this East-German town the people on the street didn’t seem to be so excited about that. We almost gave up and started packing, thinking that we would find a forest to sleep in instead. We passed a group of musicians busking and asked them about a roof, and they pointed us in the direction of an abandoned train station. When we arrived there, we saw three youngsters sitting on the porch. “Of course we have a place for you to stay! But not here.” They pushed a beer into our hands and led us to a big house in the middle of town. It was a house bursting with expression. The walls were sprayed with all kinds of political messages, the music from the bar filled the courtyard, and the table was overflowing with food. The people around the table welcomed us warmly. “Please, don’t behave” one of them said, “just eat whatever you want!” We had a roof that evening, and that was lucky, because a powerful thunderstorm put the streets of Neuruppin underwater.'

They describe themselves as anarchists and communists, but above all anti-fascists. The collective began more than 20 years ago, in 1990, when fascism was very prominent in this part of Germany. Together, as a collective, these youngsters try to be politically involved. They organize demonstrations when needed and give workshops to raise awareness around fascism.'

This was a place where they could experiment with the culture that they wanted to create. A culture free of any oppression, they called it a safe space. This meeting was important because it reminded me of the tragedy of the second world war, but also of the current forms of oppression that are maybe harder to recognize. Can we call an economic system oppressive? Or environmental damage? Can education oppress a person? What does it mean to be free?'

          content: 'About five months later, we were confronted with the theme of fascism again. This time, in an even more acute situation. During our stay in Athens, there were multiple fascist rallies going on in the center of the city. The anger in these demonstrations was often directed towards the immigrants and strangers that came from North Africa or the Middle East. It made me think back to the young people in MittenDrin and their fight for freedom and against oppression. I thought back to the warmth with which they welcomed us, three strangers, into their community.'

Over the next two days Mathijs put together a thank you video for all the people who had supported us and Caleb and Mischa responded to e-mails from future students and people who were helping to organize the Nodes. This is where we welcomed the new students when they joined us. On the second afternoon we met Annette and Doro at the local train station to bring them to “camp” — our room in the building covered in graffiti and slogans, full of neat piles of food we’d be carrying for the next four days. Annette was not new to rambling, having been part of a travelling circus previously and showed up carrying a nearly metre long cinnamon stick. Doro was more of a woodswoman, having grown up hiking through the German countryside and had been at Initiative Forum, which was where she learned about Classroom Alive.'

      content: 'Early the next morning we set off for Berlin and began a Focus Week on money. Out of Caleb’s studies of Finance and Spirit, he took the lead on providing the content for the focus week. The topic of money was one that interested all of us (Doro was studying Economy for the Common Good), so our conversations around the topic were dynamic and sometimes heated. Bit by bit we wrestled our way through questions of economic inequality, alternative currencies, and the role of money in society.'

The towns that we passed through told the story of a place where the economic ramifications of the Iron Curtain are still playing out and the memorials commemorating the concentration camp inmates who were forced to walk these roads reminded us of the recent history of where we now walked.'

Jammed into the tiny space, we watched a debate by the Cambridge Union Society on the topic “A Society of Giving is Impossible” on Mathijs’ small computer. The rain persisted the following day and providence led us to a biodynamic goat farm. There we were offered a spacious trailer to stay in for the night and split our time between meeting the goats and people there and watching another video, a documentary about Basic Income. In the evening we were treated to a cosy dinner with red wine and stepping out of our trailer in the morning we were greeted by the horse in whose paddock our trailer was located. Setting off with the added joy of fresh goat cheese in our lunches, in a few short days we found ourselves camped on the edge of the enormous city.'

      content: 'After a month of trundling through forests and towns, on June 28th we walked into our first big city. Walking into Berlin, its streets lined with glass windows continually reflecting one’s appearance, the people smelling so strongly of perfumes, the noises loudly jarring one’s thinking, we could do little more than stare at the cacophony that we encountered. Even for Annette and Doro who had only been walking for a week, the contrast between where we had come from and where we had arrived was astounding. We collapsed in Prinzessinnengarten for lunch, happy to be surrounded once more by plants, even if they in turn were surrounded by the exuberant clash of sense impressions we had just passed through.'

      content: 'In Berlin we were welcomed by members of the Journey Network and the Life Research Institute, who helped us to reflect on our first month. We then had the great pleasure of setting up shop for our first Node at Anthroposophische Hochschulgruppe. Our theme for the Node was, The Relationship between Work and Money and the Proposal for an Unconditional Basic Income. Out of our Focus Week, we brought content and questions around this theme and we had a presentation by a member of the Pirate Party (a German political party that is pushing for a national basic income).'

      content: 'A changing group of approximately thirty-five participants attended the Node.  Caleb began with a history of money and gave explanations about fractional reserve banking and compound interest. Later, Mischa offered some stories to contextualize how different cultures have related to questions of truth and rights throughout history. In the conversations that took place, we had the opportunity to look more carefully at many unconscious habits we carry with regards to money by exploring questions such as: How much is enough? What does it mean to save? What do we create with how we spend our money?  As part of this reflection, we conducted an experiment. Everybody was asked to bring an ingredient for dinner and then we all went out two hours before dinner to try to trade our ingredient with somebody on the street. The reactions we got varied from bright enthusiasm to absolute fear.'

Madalena’s passion is science, and in particular biology and medicine and we had had many conversations together about the moral questions surrounding science during the planning phase of the journey as she had been attending YIP in Järna at the time.'

      content: 'Soon our time in ‘civilization’ came to an end, and we headed back into the woods. Setting out from Berlin for our first Open Week, we were very nervous about being such a big group. Until the very last minute our numbers were changing. What was to be eleven became nine, when two students who felt sick decided to postpone joining us for a few days. Annette and Doro had both intended to continue with us, but after lunch on the first day Annette had to step back to have a doctor examine a pain in her foot. So, as we made our way further away from the great metropolis, we were eight. The three who had joined just for the open week were Maria, Lena, and Onja. With Maria conducting our little choir, Lena’s wonder for learning, and Onja’s incredible exuberance, our classroom felt blessed. We soon discovered that one of the perks of being a larger group was that it was now feasible to carry more vegetables, as the weight was spread over so many backs. It wasn’t much, but having an extra bite or two of zucchini or carrot drastically transformed meals that previously were primarily comprised of rice and spices.'

      content: 'As we walked through the brilliant greens of the Spreewald in summer and past houses half submerged in the forest, all connected by rivers and lakes, life with eight people slowly began to feel normal. The fourth day out of Berlin was full of excitement. We arrived in Furstenwalde and celebrated Lena’s birthday, the first Classroom Alive birthday, with a big fresh salad and a cake. Here we also had to say goodbye to Onja, who would re-join us again later in the walk. Before he left however, we discovered a local organic and biodynamic shop. While there, we found that they had pamphlets from the various farms that provided their produce. Onja knew one of these farms and told us that it was the oldest biodynamic farm in Germany and pointed out that our trail led directly through it. We said goodbye and were due to arrive at the farm in two days’ time, but at a fork in trails we realized we could follow the trails that crossed over the hills to the north of the farm and arrive that evening. All this involved was climbing a ski hill, albeit a little one. As we approached the farm, the woods took on an enchanted quality, and as evening came on we found ourselves timidly poking around the barn with a question. “Excuse us; we are walking from Sweden to Greece, might we camp here for the night?”'

From the tenderness of the sandy fields impossibly growing all sorts of wonders, to the warmth of the people and the warmth of the sun, (which at midday grew so hot as to melt the glue on the plastic windows of Caleb’s tent) our faces could do naught but glow with smiles. We had visited the busy pigs digging in the dirt, gone swimming in the nearby lake, received lessons on beekeeping, and concluded our time with a traditional meal of German bratwurst over a fire, fried in beer. Leaving the farm we were nine, with Helena and Phil who had stayed in Berlin having joined us, and we carried with us fresh cheese and honey from the farm.'

We snacked on tomatoes and cherries, and even smoked salmon when we happened to find ourselves camped next to a fishery, much to our delight. The supermarkets were more challenging, however, as we saw laid bare the contrast between the old way of life where local and organic don’t have labels, but are simply the only way and are sold at the side of the road, and the new wave of standardized industrial consumerism.'

We said goodbye to Germany and to the students who had joined for the week. Then we stuck out our thumbs to regroup in the Czech Republic, in Prague, where we would prepare for the Prague to Vienna Greenways portion of our walk.'
