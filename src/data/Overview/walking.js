      content: 'The fifth form, and perhaps most important, was the walking. It provided consistency each day in which to contemplate and digest our studies, gave continuity and grounding to the otherwise diffuse nature of self-directed studies, and provided a rhythm and momentum that pervaded the entire experience of the journey and studies.  There were some days when we hitchhiked, but they were the exceptions. Once a week we took a rest day. But every day we didn’t walk, somebody would remark in the evening, “I miss walking.” It was so simple, but walking four hours a day became more than just what we were doing. It became essential to our feeling of home. Although we were somewhere else every night, we often felt at home, and part of home was having walked for four hours that day to arrive there. The act penetrates one’s thinking and emotions as well as one’s body. The walking created the overall mood for the trip and permeated everything, giving a foundation for the studies.'
