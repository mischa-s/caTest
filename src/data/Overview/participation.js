      content: 'In creating Classroom Alive we were creating a school for ourselves at the same time as wanting other interested students to have the opportunity to join. To this end we felt it our duty to make the intention of Classroom Alive as clear as possible and communicate it to those who might be interested. We did not feel that we could ever say if it was the right thing for a prospective student; only they could do that. Our role was simply to make sure that any interested student had grasped the intention of Classroom Alive and then it was up to them to feel if it was right or not. For this purpose we built the website and did a presentation to communicate our intention. Prospective students would receive a package with more in-depth information about the intention and practicalities once they expressed interest. To “apply” they would send a “letter of intention” stating their planned study and why they were interested in learning in this way. From there, if we had any questions about their intentions we would organize a Skype to clarify, and if everything was clear and they decided to join we would find the appropriate time and place for them to meet-up with the rest of us.'

      content: 'Students participated for varying degrees of time from three days to six months. Along the walk we had three Open Weeks, during which individuals who were interested in joining for a short period of time could get a small taste of what it was like to be journeying and studying on Classroom Alive. In total there were thirty-three different students walking for varying amounts of time. Classroom Alive was made infinitely more valuable by the diversity of students who participated. At times however, the turnover of students began making it challenging to create a feeling of continuity in our community. While each Open Week brought with it a great rush of inspiration it was important that for the last two months of the journey we were mostly the same group of eleven students. Having this continuity played a large role in creating the strength and efficiency in our studies and organizational process that manifested towards the end of the journey. '
