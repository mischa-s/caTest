      content: 'The impulse for this journey came from the students. We all enjoyed an incurable curiosity about the world. It began with conversations about living, studying, and working together. How could we create a student community for ourselves where our lives, our studies, and our sustenance were de-compartmentalized? How could we take up our shared interests, leave time for each person to focus on their own interests, support one another, and do it all in a way such that we would remember to experience life as beautiful and sacred'

      content: '      Out of a larger group of students who were working on these questions, three of us committed to this project and set about discovering the form in which it could manifest. It was important for us to start from where we were and see where it would lead. The economy is on everybodyâ€™s mind these days, and questions about this interested all of us. This put Greece on the map because of the Euro Crisis. By starting in Northern Europe, we began in a culture like the one in which we had grown up. Passing through Germany we experienced the polarity of the Euro crisis every time we remembered that we were en route to Athens. But economy was only one topic which gave this trajectory meaning. Ancient Greece played a central role in incubating the western culture that dominates the world. Therefore any exploration of the world in which we find ourselves necessitates an exploration of Greek philosophy and thought. We wanted to follow these ideas back to the places where they originally emerged.'

      content: 'Walking was the element that unified the journey and gave rhythm to the slow immersion in the landscapes, cultures, and encounters with people along the way. While walking, our questions would be freed, our thinking sparked by inspiration, and our physical bodies engaged in movement. With walking, we could have time for ourselves and time for conversations. We could let our learning come not just through books, but also through real meetings with the world. This was the idea, and in March 2013, we began designing the forms that would create our school and inviting other students to join us for this walking, studying adventure!'
