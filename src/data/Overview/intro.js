Over the course of this journey school, thirty-three students joined the classroom. Some joined for a week, some for a month, and some for longer.'

      content: 'The form was simple. Each day would see us study for four hours and walk for four hours, each aspect enriching the other. Every student would create and follow their own curriculum of reading and writing, or other modes such as drawing. There would be Focus Weeks for exploring content together. In six cities along the way there would be Nodes - opportunities for students to share their learning and engage with the local community. Students who wanted to join for a short period of time could join one of the three Open Weeks.'

      content: 'To cover this distance in the time between when it got warm enough to study outside in Sweden and when it got too cold in Greece, we would hitchhike some sections of the journey. But most days we would walk, fifteen kilometres or four hours, and study, and make camp - between pastures, in abandoned buildings, in beautiful wilderness, and on mountaintops.'
