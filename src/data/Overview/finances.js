But even on a minimal budget, we set out without enough money to make it to Athens. Having done what we could during the preparation phase we simply started; and by the time we had arrived in the south of Sweden, we had enough support to make it all the way. '

      content: 'We knew from the beginning that we wanted to make the journey accessible to all students who felt that it was what they needed for their studies. To this end, we decided that all costs would be covered out of a shared pot. Students who were joining were invited to contribute what they felt they could and would have all their costs covered out of the shared pot. As a point of reference, those who were joining for a shorter period of time were told how much had been spent per person per day for the time they were with us. For the students who were joining for a longer period of time, we used an estimated cost of sixty Euros per week and again they were invited to contribute whatever they could. '

      content: 'Although the daily expenses varied from country to country, and there were additional costs, such as replacing shoes and other gear, this number proved a good estimate. One oversight in our calculations was that we did not include a budget for the two weeks after our arrival in Athens, which were essential to wrapping up the trip. As a group of eleven at that point, our expenses for room and board were not insignificant.'

We offered private donors the option of making a monthly pledge as a way to foster a sense that their gifts were an ongoing participation in the project rather than an isolated act.'
