      content: 'Classroom Alive was a self-organizing school. It was created and run entirely by the students for the students. All elements of the organization were managed by students on the walk. The two exceptions to this were in the preparation phase when we had a mentor/consultant and secretary who helped during the design process. Our organizational model also evolved over the journey. When we set out, it consisted of a completely organic process of consensus decision making.  Over time, as more students joined and we become a larger collective creating the experience together, our model had to change to provide better structure and inclusion. When the decision making process was not clear and our group grew, more and more energy was wasted on circular conversations which could easily have been streamlined. Tasks which had been simple for three also grew in complexity, and so again what had previously happened spontaneously and organically, now required more structure. At the start of the journey there was also a core team, made up of the three students who designed the journey. This core team had final veto power with the mandate of maintaining the integrity of the original intention of Classroom Alive.'

      content: 'During the journey we went through different iterations of decision making and task allocation models, but by the final third of the journey we had created a functioning model called Decision Alive. There were a set of teams each with their own responsibilities (food, route, communication, etc.) all of whom had autonomy in their decision making process and worked with a mandate of following the collective goals. If ever someone felt that a decision was being made that they could not accept, there was always the chance to bring it to a group consensus process. We would meet every route cycle (approximately one to two weeks) to reflect and give feedback to each team and re-assign students to groups.'

      content: 'We found that having clearly defined responsibilities and making authority transparent was essential to creating a healthy and efficient organizational process. The clarity and accessibility of the form also made it possible for everyone to participate and take up the elements of the organization they felt they could best facilitate. In the end, collaboratively running the organization always came down to empowering each other in our given responsibilities, and listening to the needs of the group when it came to enacting the responsibilities we had been given.'

      content: 'Running an organization was a time consuming activity, especially making decisions; however, there was valuable learning taking place in this time. From the outset Classroom Alive aimed to be a collaborative learning space. The ability to truly co-create, whether it is in one’s community or workplace, is immensely challenging and Classroom Alive was an educational context aimed to provide a learning environment which would give immediate experience and practice in this field. Though at times many of us felt that the organizational process was beginning to take over the experience entirely, as our model developed we were given direct insight into working through difficult collaborative challenges.

      content: 'By the end of the journey, while we had come a long way in creating an efficient, transparent, and inclusive organizational model, questions concerning authority and ownership remained to some degree unanswered. At the end of the journey it still seemed there were some students who had more authority over the organization than others, while the defining features of that authority and what granted it was unclear. This was concerning particularly the three students who had originally been designated the “core team”. Did they maintain a fundamental responsibility and authority to the organization because they had set the original intention? Additionally, amongst the other students there was a clear difference between those who had been walking for a week and those for a month, but what were the defining features of their difference when it came to authority in the co-creation of the organization? Although there were many conversations around these topics, all of which had no definitive answer, it was agreed that clarity and transparency were the direction that we all felt the process must continually move towards.'
