      content: 'Individual Research was the foundation of each student’s curriculum. Every day would consist of approximately four hours of study sessions. This time was generally divided into two shorter sessions and took place in fields, mountains, or cafes, wherever we could find a comfortable enough pop-up classroom. These study sessions, in which each student would undertake individual research, whether it be reading about Darwin or drawing portraits, made up the bulk of the students’ studies. How each student’s individual research manifested was different. The majority of students built their individual research around the reading of a course of pre-selected books. Most students who walked for more than a week used e-readers to increase the size of the library they were able to carry. Writing also played a role in the studies for many students. Other modes of study included drawing (portraits and comics), recording of audio and video, yoga, and meditative inquiry.'

      content: 'Before joining Classroom Alive and after choosing their topic of study, each student was encouraged to find one or more mentors outside Classroom Alive and decide how they would communicate what they learned. Over the course of the journey, the pre-determined study plans proved difficult to maintain for a variety of reasons. While students’ chosen subjects of study did not change dramatically over their time with Classroom Alive, often the clear and precise questions with which they entered took on new forms. The experience of the changing, chaotic, and creative environment, of a life lived outdoors on the road, took students by the nose and guided them to their questions from unintended, delightful, and surprising angles.'
