      content: 'At the start of the journey we met every evening to hear from each other about how we were doing, both physically and in our studies. As the number of students grew it became clear that these daily check-ins were both time consuming and did not allow enough time to give depth to any one student. In the second month of the journey we split the check-ins into two categories, community, and studies. The study check-ins happened every week. They provided a time for each student to share a short insight with the group into their past week of study and their intentions for the coming week. This allowed students to follow each otherâ€™s paths of study, pursuing possible mutual interests and also provided a weekly space to re-state and focus our collective intention for studying. This simple act of regularly joining around the intention to be living a certain way, that is journeying and studying, played a fundamental role in holding the experience together. Regularly sharing our intentions created the culture of the experience. It was a culture of commitment and passion for learning that made studies possible amidst the variables and chaos of a nomadic life. '

      content: 'The Mentor Groups were created as an in-depth extension of the check-ins. Mentor groups were made up of three to four students who would meet on a weekly basis, while walking or in a study session. In the mentor groups students would give a more in-depth explanation of their studies while a small group of their peers would witness, support and challenge them. In mentor groups students could hold each other accountable to their individual goals while supporting them to find the resources, materials and practices to best conduct their studies. This form grew through the journey and we felt it still had a lot of potential to offer us when it concluded upon our arrival in Athens. For a while after completing the journey, we maintained a practise of sharing what we were learning with one another online, but this could not fill the gap of dedicating an afternoon on a weekly basis to sharing, questioning, and mirroring in person.'
