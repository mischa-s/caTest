      content: 'The Focus Weeks were designed as a point of intersection, where students with similar interests could gather around a chosen topic. We planned five Focus Weeks when making the schedule without knowing what each one would be. Although they did not all manifest with the clarity of form we originally intended, all five Focus Week were carried out. The three most extensive ones were on the themes of The Passion of the Western Mind by Richard Tarnas, Money and Basic Income, and The Philosophy of Freedom by Rudolf Steiner. The two other Focus Weeks, Christine Gruwezâ€™s Walking with Your Time and the European Debt Crisis brought a lot of content to our group conversations, however, we struggled to take the time to really go into each of them. During these weeks, we had many fruitful conversations, deepening our knowledge and teaching one another.'

      content: 'The walking environment supported these weeks, especially with The Philosophy of Freedom Focus Week in the Bulgarian mountains. The struggles we encountered in the final two Focus Weeks were largely due to the fact that we were in the final month of our journey and everyone was too excited about their own studies to break for something else. Overall, the shared focus topics were very beneficial, but would have benefitted from more planning and preparation.'
