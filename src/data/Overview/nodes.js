      content: 'The Nodes were designed to give us the opportunity to speak about our studies in the places we were passing through and to hear from the people we met about their work. We had planned six Nodes, managing three as planned and three more spontaneously. Our first three Nodes, Basic Income in Berlin, (Bio)Diversity in Vienna, and Higher Education in Budapest, happened as concrete manifestations around particular subjects. In Berlin and Vienna, we partnered with local organizations and were able to create indoor events with between 15 to 35 participants. By the time we got to Budapest, we no longer had the network to organize events, but opted instead for a public classroom outside and in this way got a great deal of participation. During these three Nodes, we were able to create opportunities for us as students to teach, and also to receive valuable input for our studies from those who attended the Nodes.'

      content: 'By the time we arrived at our fourth Node, in Sofia, Bulgaria, we were coming off nearly a month of very wild trekking in Romania and Serbia. In addition, we were about to face down the most difficult challenge of our journey, the Bulgarian mountains. We were fortunate to be able to visit several organizations in the city, but were not able to bring form to our time there as clearly as we had in previous cities. Our fifth Node happened of its own accord, a simple meeting of the eleven of us who were walking at the time with the four women at the Living Wholeness Institute, Axladitsa halfway down the eastern coast of Greece. In this meeting our studies were deepened, our journey was mirrored, and we began the process of closing. The sixth and final Node was in Athens. While in Athens, we gave a couple of presentations about our journey to people working with education, and worked with Christine Gruwez around the theme of ‘life and form’. This provided the opportunity to reflect on the forces that provided the impetus for creating Classroom Alive, and to see how the form evolved over the course of the journey.'

      content: 'Upon reflection, trying to organize six events in cities that most of us had never been to, with limited internet connectivity, while living mostly at the slow pace of walking, was ambitious. Although not all of the Nodes worked out as we had thought they would beforehand, they became moments of possibility on our schedule and, upon arrival in the city, we were able to take up what was needed at that point in our journey. The Nodes became what we needed in that moment.'
